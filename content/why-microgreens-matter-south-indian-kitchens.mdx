Microgreens aren't just garnish anymore—they're functional food, fast revenue, and a community movement across South India. Here's why GreenGrow Academy is doubling down on these nutrient-dense shoots and the growers behind them. 🌾

## Health on the plate

- **Dense nutrition, tiny footprint**: Brassica microgreens deliver up to 40x the vitamins of mature vegetables, making them perfect for quick recovery meals.
- **Regional recipes reimagined**: Alumni fold microgreens into idli podis, millet bowls, and Kerala stews for a post-harvest vitamin boost.
- **Dietitian-approved plans**: Our mentor panel pairs greens with diabetic-friendly menus and hospital recovery diets.

## Income for small spaces

Many of our growers operate from 120 sq. ft balconies or repurposed garages. With stacked trays and climate playbooks, they:

- Harvest every 7–10 days, keeping cash flow predictable.
- Earn ₹40,000–₹1,20,000 per month supplying to cafés, meal-prep brands, and wellness stores.
- Upgrade from hobby kits to HACCP-compliant facilities in under six months.

## Sustainability without guesswork

We track the impact across cohorts:

| Impact area                  | Average outcome per grower |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Water saved vs. soil farming | 82%                        |
| Organic waste diverted       | 36 kg/month                |
| Pesticide usage              | 0%                         |
