We're thrilled to introduce **GreenGrow Academy**, South India's first cohort-based program focused solely on microgreens. From seed selection to subscription sales, we coach urban growers and hospitality teams to harvest nutrient-rich trays in as little as 14 days. 🌿

## Why microgreens, why now?

Busy families and chefs want fresh garnishes that grow fast, demand little space, and command premium pricing. Yet aspiring growers struggle with:

- High humidity and erratic power outages that spoil trays
- Limited access to food-safe packaging and chill chains
- No playbook for pricing, marketing, or institutional compliance

GreenGrow bridges agronomy, business, and community so these hurdles disappear.

## What you'll experience inside the academy

1. **Studio intensives** — Practice sowing, misting, and harvesting 25+ varieties in our climate-controlled labs.
2. **Mentor hotline** — Agronomists, dietitians, and business coaches respond within minutes on WhatsApp.
3. **Buyer matchmaking** — We introduce you to chefs, cafés, hospitals, and subscription customers who crave reliable supply.

## Curriculum snapshot

- **Grow science fundamentals**: Germination, blackout schedules, contamination prevention, and nutrient retention.
- **Packaging & compliance**: FSSAI labeling templates, delivery SOPs, and cold-chain partner directory.
- **Revenue systems**: Subscription pricing, tasting events, influencer demos, and B2B contracts.
- **Brand storytelling**: Position your microgreens for wellness seekers, restaurants, or institutional nutrition.
