Launching a profitable microgreen brand rarely follows a straight line. At **GreenGrow Academy**, we blend climate-ready agronomy, business mentorship, and a vibrant alumni network so you can harvest confidently in just a few weeks. 🌱

## The hurdles new growers face

Before joining us, most first-time growers share the same stumbling blocks:

- Guesswork around sowing density and humidity control in tropical apartments
- Limited access to trustworthy seed suppliers and food-safe packaging
- Difficulty pricing trays sustainably without alienating early customers

## How the cohort solves them

Each four-week intensive mixes studio labs with remote mentor touchpoints:

1. **Climate-calibrated agronomy** — Learn tray prep, misting cadence, and blackout management tuned for South Indian weather.
2. **Compliance on autopilot** — Templates cover FSSAI labeling, cold-chain checklists, and hygiene SOPs for institutional buyers.
3. **Market immersion** — Weekly pitch circles with chefs, nutritionists, and hospital dietitians sharpen your value proposition.

## Pillars of the GreenGrow method

- **Hands-on grow labs**: Practice with brassica, amaranth, and pea shoots while mentors audit your workflow.
- **Revenue playbooks**: Model subscription offerings, tasting events, and B2B contracts with alumni case studies.
- **Regional community**: WhatsApp cohorts in 14 cities respond in under 15 minutes to pest scares or pH spikes.
- **Scaling roadmap**: Access supplier directories, packaging partners, and ROI calculators once you cross your first 50 trays.
